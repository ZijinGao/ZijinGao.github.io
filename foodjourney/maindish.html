				Here comes the main dish, the most important part of a meal!<br><br>
				This is not an exaggeration: you are what you eat.<br>
				First, smart dining choices can lead to positive results in both your mental condition and physical one,<br> 
				while bad eating habit can cause terrible consequences. <br>Usu ex tractatos petentium, vis an perpetua omittantur.<br><br>

				What's more, having the awareness that food should be treated carefully means the positive attitude towards life.<br>Be grateful for what we have in hand and make them the best food that they can be so that we don't let the nature down.<br>
				It is also a sign of self-care when we eat carefully, patiently and with balance, because in this way we take care of our own body.<br>
