				So why food? 
				Before we get down to business,<br>
				I want to spend a little time explaining to you<br>
				why I chose food as tonight's theme.<br><br>

				For a long time in history,<br>
				being able to feed oneself has been the ultimate goal for human being.<br>
				However, as time goes by, people became more powerful<br>
				and consequently they desire more than just being full -- <br>
				they wanted to enjoy what they ate.<br><br>

				From then on, food as been developed rapidly into various styles and flavors. <br>
				Now, food had surpassed the gap between cultures and geographical regions, <br>
				and become an expression of people's lifestyle.<br> 
				This is why food becomes such an important and interesting topic for now.<br> 
				Because what you eat, to some extent, says who you are.
