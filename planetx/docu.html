			In the form of a variation of <span><em>Conway's Game of Life</em></span>, this game aims to explore the possibility in the future, when technology has taken over every aspect of human's life and people have to try hard to maintain the balance of modern technology and the nature which they originally come from.<br><br>
			At the start of the game, user will be given a "blank" (actually black but has no elements on it) world where they can choose to put <em>nuclear stations</em>,<em>forests</em>, and <em>water areas</em> onto the landscape and build their world. <br><br>These elements all have different properties.
			The nuclear stations generate the necessary nuclaer energy to the world, while they also accumulate nuclear waste which will pollute the areas near them; The forests and water areas respectively generate natural energy and brings up the sanitation level of the world, yet planting too many of them will leave not enough space for the nuclear stations to be placed. The eventual goal will be to evolve human being, and the only way to achieve this is to reach and keep the balance between natural energy, nuclear energy and sanitation level.

			To start with, I built on Professor Kapp's sample code and was able to plant one single element onto the canvas. I started from the nuclear station and they looked and evolved like below in a rapid speed:<br><br>
			<div class="imgGroup">
				<img src="assets/1-1.png" class="image">
				<img src="assets/1-2.png" class="image">
				<img src="assets/1-3.png" class="image">
				<img src="assets/1-4.png" class="image">
				<img src="assets/1-5.png" class="image">
			</div><br>
			I also put up text on each grid so that I know the value of nuclear waste for every grid and can tell whether the program is working in the right wayï¼š <br><br>
			<div class="imgGroup">
				<img src="assets/1-6.png" class="image">
				<img src="assets/1-7.png" class="image">
			</div><br>
			The yellow "X" on the grids were to stand for holes created because of nuclear radiation. These areas are permanently disabled from becoming any kinds of area later in the game. <br><br>
			Now the game looks fine, but it can only bring users a destroied world no matter how the user design their landscape. Now I have to implement the three elements all into the game. <br>
			After some update, the game now looks like this:<br><br>
			<div class="imgGroup">
				<img src="assets/2-1.png" class="image">
				<img src="assets/2-2.png" class="image">
				<img src="assets/2-3.png" class="image">
				<img src="assets/2-4.png" class="image">
			</div><br>
			The problem now is that there seems to be some problem with color. For the convenience of debugging, I set the parameters of water, forest and nuclear all to the same value, yet on the screen the nuclear waste seems to be conquering all over the canvas. I was not sure whether it was because I mapped the value to the opacity of each area's designated color and for different color they have different visibility on black even when their opacity are the same, for example (assuming) (255,0,0,0.5) is easier to be distinguished against black than (0,255,0,0.5); <br><br>
			I solved the problem by switching color mode to HSB. Now I only need to map the values proportional to the "B" value of each area. Now the landscape looks like this. <br><br>
