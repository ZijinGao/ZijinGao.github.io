			For my midterm project, I have two ideas in mind and have not decided which one to go for. I will write about both of them here and decide very soon which one to go after. 
			<br><br>
			My first idea is to build a ecosystem that has physical control/sound control from user. One possible version would be that there are blocks of fish and other creatures in the scene, and when the viewer speak the the microphone/ change the physical control, the movement of the creatures in the scene change as if they can here the viewer's voice. Each block of creature shall also have their own unique behavior, for example fish should stay together in a group and grass will swing as there is mild breeze around them. 

			<br><br>
			My second idea is to create my own <span><em>Conway's game of life</em></span>. The cells shall behave according to my personally-defined rules and shall contain more variations.
			<br><br>
			The reason why I have these two ideas is that I have always been interested in creating a nature-imitating scene and have a strong interest in bringing physical and digital experience together for the audience.
			<br>
			Conway's game of life, on the other hand, appeals to me for a philosophical reason. It reveals a deeper message that prevail all around the world and it is exciting for me to explore it further in game.
